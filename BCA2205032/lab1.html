                <td>Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, 
                    the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations, and daily activities. 
                    Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition,[1] moderate
                    -vigorous physical exercise,[2]and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.[3]
                    Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to 
                    carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue or lethargy.
                    However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, physical fitness is now
                    considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively
                    in work and leisure activities,to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, to improve 
                    immune system function, and to meet emergency situations.</td>
                <td>Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.
                    Exercise sends oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. 
                    And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.</td>
                <td>There are five components of physical fitness: (1) body composition, (2) flexibility,
                    (3) muscular strength, (4) muscular endurance, and (5) cardiorespiratory endurance.
                     A well-balanced exercise program should include activities that address all of the health-related components of fitness.</td>
